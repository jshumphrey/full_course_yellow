"""This bot monitors various motorsport Discord servers for new instances
where a user is banned from the server, or other critera as specified
for that server.

When a new ban is detected, a message is sent to the "Staff of Motorsport
Discords" server, alerting all mod staff of the new ban, and providing
information about whether the newly-banned user is present in any of the
